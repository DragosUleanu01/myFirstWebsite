# myFirstWebsite
A website made using html and css only. This website presents a small history of computers and in particular talks about Romanian Computers.  

I made this website back when I was a beginner in web design, all they way in my first year of studying Computer Science. I have put it here as a statement of how much I have grown since those times.

The website contains all the basic html structures such as ordered and un-ordered lists, tables, references and links.
